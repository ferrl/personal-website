    <p>As a extension of the SignUp Content <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr>, I've developed a much more complex subscription e-commerce for <a href="http://inversapub.com" hreflang="pt-BR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Inversa Publicações</a>. Following a lot of specific business rules, this was the most challenging project I've developed thus far.</p>
    <p>The infrastructure was also challenging, currently there is about 10 web servers active across the globe and 4 workers to handle asynchronous tasks, such as payments, mail sending, notifications and invoicing.</p>
